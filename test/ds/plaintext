Now that the party is jumping
With the bass kicked in and the Vega's are pumpin
Quick to the point, to the point, no faking
Cooking MC's like a pound of bacon
Burning 'em, if you ain't quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
And a high hat with a souped up tempo
I'm on a roll, it's time to go solo
ollin' in my five point oh
ith my rag-top down so my hair can blow
